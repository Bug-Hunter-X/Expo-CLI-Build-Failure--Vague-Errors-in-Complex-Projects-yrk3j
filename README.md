# Expo CLI Build Failure: Vague Errors in Complex Projects

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo CLI where build failures occur with vague error messages when the project structure is complex. The issue is not consistently reproducible and the error messages are often not specific enough to pinpoint the root cause. The project may have multiple nested directories or unusual dependencies in the package.json file.

**Steps to Reproduce (may vary depending on project complexity):**

1. Create a new Expo project with a non-standard directory structure.
2. Add some dependencies with potentially conflicting versions or unusual configurations.
3. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`.
4. Observe vague error messages that don't clearly indicate the source of the problem.

**Solution (see `bugSolution.js`):**

The most common solution is to simplify the project structure and carefully examine the package.json file for any potentially problematic dependencies.  Using the latest versions of the Expo CLI and relevant packages is often beneficial.  Additional debugging techniques and logs might be necessary to identify the specific cause in more complex cases.
