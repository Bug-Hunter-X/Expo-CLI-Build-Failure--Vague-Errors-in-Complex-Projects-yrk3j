To solve this issue, start by simplifying your project structure. If possible, move your project files to a single directory. Avoid nesting directories unnecessarily.  Next, examine your `package.json` file carefully.  Look for dependencies with known incompatibility issues or those that might conflict with other packages. Try updating packages to their latest versions. If a package is causing a build issue, you can try replacing it with an alternative that performs the same function.  If all else fails, you can use debugging techniques such as adding console logs strategically to narrow down the source of the issue.  Use the Expo CLI's verbose mode (`--verbose`) to get more detailed build logs.
