This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a complex or unusual project structure.  For example, if your project has multiple nested directories, or if your project's package.json file contains unusual dependencies, Expo CLI might fail to correctly identify or build your project. The error message may be vague or unhelpful, such as a generic 'Build failed' message or an error indicating a problem with a specific dependency.
